title: 'React: A Detailed Overview'
---

React is a highly popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook, designed for
building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where dynamic content is rendered
efficiently. Known for its declarative approach and component-based architecture, React enables
developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, resulting in modular and
maintainable code. One of its standout features is the virtual DOM, which optimizes rendering by
updating only the parts of the user interface that have changed, leading to enhanced performance.
React's extensive ecosystem, including tools like React Router for navigation and Redux for state
management, further empowers developers to build complex, interactive web applications with relative
ease. Its flexibility and robust community support make React a go-to choice for modern web
development.

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
