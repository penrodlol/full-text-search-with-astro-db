title: 'Astro: A Exploratory Overview'
---

Astro is a modern web development framework designed to build fast, content-focused websites with
ease. It offers a unique approach by allowing developers to mix and match various frontend
frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte within a single project while optimizing for performance
through server-side rendering and a lightweight client-side footprint. Astro emphasizes the use of
static site generation, ensuring that sites are fast to load and highly scalable. By automatically
stripping away unnecessary JavaScript, Astro delivers only what's needed for each page,
significantly enhancing loading times and overall user experience. This framework is particularly
well-suited for blogs, marketing sites, and other content-heavy applications, providing a powerful
toolset for developers aiming to create performant and maintainable web projects.

```astro
<div>
  <h1>Counter: <span data-count>0</span></h1>
  <button data-increment>Increment</button>
  <button data-decrement>Decrement</button>
</div>

<script>
  document.querySelector('[data-increment]').addEventListener('click', () => {
    const count = document.querySelector('[data-count]');
    count.textContent = Number(count.textContent) + 1;
  });

  document.querySelector('[data-decrement]').addEventListener('click', () => {
    const count = document.querySelector('[data-count]');
    count.textContent = Number(count.textContent) - 1;
  });
</script>
```
