title: 'Angular: A Comprehensive Overview'
---


Angular is a robust, open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google,
designed to simplify the development and testing of single-page applications (SPAs). Utilizing
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, Angular provides developers with strong typing, improved
tooling, and better code maintainability. The framework's architecture is built around components
and services, facilitating modular development and reusability. Angular's powerful features include
two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a comprehensive suite of tools for routing, forms,
and HTTP client functionalities. With its extensive ecosystem, Angular enables developers to create
complex, scalable, and high-performance web applications, making it a popular choice for
enterprise-level projects and large-scale applications.



```ts
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {{ count() }}</h1>
      <button (click)="count.update(value => value + 1)">Increment</button>
      <button (click)="count.update(value => value - 1)">Decrement</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  readonly count = signal<number>(0);
}
```
